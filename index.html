            <p>In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the TuriCreate API offered by Apple to differentiate between cats and dogs by creating an image recognition app of our own using a custom dataset.</p>
            <p>We will be training our own machine learning model using images of cats and dogs, and exporting it for use in IOS devices.</p>
            <p>This tutorial is designed with begginers in mind, who are interested in learning how to use the API for image recognition purposes.</p>
            <p>Why turicreate?<br> Turicreate, now owned by Apple, makes the machine learning process extremely simple. It does a lot of laborous work for us, such as resizing images, and training/testing the model. This is perfect for beginners and app developers who do not want to spend time learning the implementation details of machine learning and convolution networks.</p>

            <p>For this project, we would be needing:<br>1. A computer running mac OS.<br>2. Any version of python >= 2.7.14 which can be found <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a><br>3. A version of Xcode version >= enter number<br>4. An installation of PIP.<br> PIP is a tool for managing and installing python packages. It can be installed by opening the terminal and typing:</p>
            <blockquote>sudo easy_install pip</blockquote>
            <p>Lets go ahead and install TuriCreate by typing the following command in your terminal:</p>
            <blockquote>pip install turicreate</blockquote>
            <p>Now we would need something to make the image downloading process simpler for us. We will be using <a href ="https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download">google-images-download</a> by github user Hardikvasa. To install this, type in the command:</p>
            <blockquote>pip install google_images_download</blockquote>
            <p>Congratulations! We are done with the installations, so let's go ahead and get started.</p>

              <p>The first step for us is to gather our dataset. A machine learning model can only be as good as the data it is trained on. If the data is skewed, the output results from the machine learning model also have a high chance of being incorrect.</p>
              <p>In your command line, enter the first two lines one after the other, and read the comments (lines starting with #) to understand what each of these lines does.</p>
